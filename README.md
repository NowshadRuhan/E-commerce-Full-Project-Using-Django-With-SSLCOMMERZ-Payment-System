## About Crispy forms in python:
Django-crispy-forms supports several frontend frameworks, such as Twitter Bootstrap (versions 2, 3, and 4), Uni-form and Foundation. You can also easily adapt your custom company's one, creating your own, see the docs for more information. You can easily switch among them using CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK setting variable.

### Installing django-crispy-forms:

**Install latest stable version into your python environment using pip:**
- pip install django-crispy-forms

**If you want to install development version (unstable), you can do so doing:**
- pip install git+git://github.com/django-crispy-forms/django-crispy-forms.git@dev#egg=django-crispy-forms


**Once installed add crispy_forms to your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py:**

### About Media Files in Django:
In Django, files which are uploaded by the user are called Media or Media Files. Here are some examples:
1. A user uploaded image, pdfs, doc files etc while publishing a post.
2. Images of products in an e-commerce site.
3. User's profile image. etc...

**Just as with static files, to serve media files we have do add some configurations in our settings.py file.**

#### Media Files Configurations:
Media files depend upon two configurations,
1. MEDIA_ROOT,
2. MEDIA_URL

**In settings.py file:**
```
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),
]

MEDIA_ROOT  = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
```

**In the main project urls.py file:**
```
from django.conf.urls import url, include
from django.contrib import admin
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```
### About static File in Django:
In static folder we store our all of css, js, bootstrap file to use those file in our project.

**Settings added**
```
from django.conf import settings
```
**static and static_url added**
```
from django.conf.urls.static import static
```
